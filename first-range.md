# Step 3: Range Values

![Temperature values overlaid on grid](images/playground_temperature_coverage_with_values.png)

We know the temperature of each grid cell from the image above.
In CoverageJSON data values are associated with grid cells with the help of a multi-dimensional array that is encoded as a flat one-dimensional array, here called NdArray. In general Coverage terminology, the set of values of a parameter are also called the Range. NdArray is one particular encoding scheme for Range values. Let's have a look at the code first:
```js
{
  "type" : "NdArray",
  "dataType": "float",
  "axisNames": ["y", "x"],
  "shape": [4, 4],
  "values" : [
    17.3, 18.2, 16.5, 18.7,
    18.1, 19.4, 17.2, 18.6,
    19.2, 20.4, 21.1, 20.7,
    21.1, 21.3, 20.5, 19.2
  ]
}
```
We can see that the values (by the way, missing values would become `null`) appear in the same layout as in the image above.
There are two reasons for that:

1. NdArrays always use [row-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order).
The first array axis is `y` (latitude) and the second axis `x` (longitude), as given in `axisNames`.
With row-major order, the indices of the rightmost axis, here `x`, vary fastest.
This means that you start with `y=0` and iterate through `x=0..3`, then `y=1` and again `x=0..3`, until `y=3`.
2. The connection between NdArray axis indices and Domain axis coordinates is established by the ordering of the Domain axis.
There is a difference between an axis going from 54째 to 48째 and one going from 48째 to 54째.

If we had switched the NdArray axis order around from y-x to x-y, then our array would look like that:
```js
{
  "type" : "NdArray",
  "dataType": "float",
  "axisNames": ["x", "y"],
  "shape": [4, 4],
  "values" : [
    17.3, 18.1, 19.2, 21.1,
    18.2, 19.4, 20.4, 21.3,
    16.5, 17.2, 21.1, 20.5,
    18.7, 18.6, 20.7, 19.2
  ]
}
```
Columns become rows, and rows become columns.
