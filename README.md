# CoverageJSON Cookbook

This cookbook introduces the [CoverageJSON](http://covjson.org) format in an interactive and easy way. It is targeted at anyone who wants to create or understand CoverageJSON documents. It makes use of the [CoverageJSON Playground](http://covjson.org/playground/) which is a web tool that visualizes CoverageJSON documents and allows to edit them with immediate feedback.
