# CoverageJSON Cookbook

This cookbook introduces the [CoverageJSON](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/coveragejson/blob/master/spec.md) format in an interactive and easy way. It is targeted at anyone who wants to create or understand CoverageJSON documents. It makes use of the [CoverageJSON Playground](http://reading-escience-centre.github.io/covjson-playground/) which is a web tool that visualizes CoverageJSON documents and allows to edit them with immediate feedback.
